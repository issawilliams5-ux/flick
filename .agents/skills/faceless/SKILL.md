# /faceless

Create a character-pair faceless reel from a script the user provides.

## Scope

This skill starts from the supplied source script. Do not research a company, visit its website, find a viral angle, ask for a logo, send Telegram messages, call n8n, or create a thumbnail.

The source script is the source of truth. Preserve its facts, sequence, intent, and call to action while adapting it into the selected character conversation.

## Output workspace

Create `faceless-output/` in the current project. If it already exists, create `faceless-output-YYYY-MM-DD-HHmmss/` instead.

Derive a lowercase, hyphenated topic slug from the supplied script using two or three words. If the topic cannot be determined confidently, ask the user for the topic name. Use the same slug for every artifact in this run.

```text
faceless-output/
  scripts/<topic-slug>/
    source-script.txt
    dialogue.json
    caption.txt
  audio/<topic-slug>/
    000.mp3
    001.mp3
    full-dialogue.mp3
    audio-manifest.json
  video/<topic-slug>/
    final-faceless-reel.mp4
```

Only `scripts/<topic-slug>/` is created during script generation. `audio/<topic-slug>/` is created during successful local Fish audio generation. `video/<topic-slug>/` is created only after the user approves video generation.

## Step 1: Ensure Fish Audio is set up

Run:

```text
node <faceless-skill>/scripts/doctor.mjs
```

This preflight check reports whether Node.js, local FFmpeg, Fish Audio, and the Minecraft template pack are ready. If needed, Faceless sets up its local FFmpeg copy immediately before audio generation, before it calls Fish Audio.

Then run:

```text
node <faceless-skill>/scripts/setup-fish.mjs --status
```

If Fish is not configured, show the user this message:

> Create your Fish Audio API key here: https://fish.audio/app/api-keys/

Then run the local setup helper in an interactive terminal:

```text
node <faceless-skill>/scripts/setup-fish.mjs
```

On Windows, the setup helper opens a visible local input box with a character count. Other systems use a visible local terminal prompt. Do not ask the user to paste an API key into the chat, do not repeat it, and do not write it into the project workspace, source script, JSON, caption, or logs.

## Step 2: Choose the character pair

Ask exactly:

> Which script would you like to create: Peter & Stewie or Rick & Morty?

Keep the selected pair for the entire run. Read [references/dialogue-json-schema.md](references/dialogue-json-schema.md) to use the correct voice IDs.

## Step 3: Get the source script

Ask the user to paste the source script to turn into character dialogue.

Write the supplied text unchanged to `scripts/<topic-slug>/source-script.txt`.

## Step 4: Create the dialogue

Read [references/script-generation.md](references/script-generation.md) and [references/dialogue-json-schema.md](references/dialogue-json-schema.md).

Create the dialogue JSON and write it to `scripts/<topic-slug>/dialogue.json`. Create the Instagram caption and write it to `scripts/<topic-slug>/caption.txt`.

Show the complete dialogue JSON and caption. Then ask:

> Does this look good? Should I generate the audio?

If the user requests edits, revise the source-derived dialogue and caption before asking again.

## Step 5: Generate audio after approval

Read [references/audio-generation.md](references/audio-generation.md).

Run:

```text
node <faceless-skill>/scripts/ensure-ffmpeg.mjs
node <faceless-skill>/scripts/generate-audio.mjs --script <output-directory>/scripts/<topic-slug>/dialogue.json --topic <topic-slug> --output <output-directory>
```

Never claim that audio exists until every expected individual MP3, `full-dialogue.mp3`, and `audio-manifest.json` have been verified locally.

After successful audio generation, report the local audio folder and ask:

> Audio is ready locally. Do you want to generate the video?

## Step 6: Generate video after approval

Only if the user says yes, read [references/video-generation.md](references/video-generation.md) and run:

```text
node <faceless-skill>/scripts/download-templates.mjs --status
```

If the templates are not ready, ask exactly:

> Minecraft templates are not installed yet. The pack is about 2.4 GB. Download it now?

Only if the user says yes, run:

```text
node <faceless-skill>/scripts/download-templates.mjs --replace
```

Then run:

```text
node <faceless-skill>/scripts/generate-video.mjs --audio <output-directory>/audio/<topic-slug>/full-dialogue.mp3 --topic <topic-slug> --output <output-directory>
```

Never claim that the video exists until `video/<topic-slug>/final-faceless-reel.mp4` has been verified locally.

After verification, ask:

> Your Minecraft video is ready. Can I add the characters now?

If the user says yes, run:

```text
node <faceless-skill>/scripts/add-characters.mjs --video <output-directory>/video/<topic-slug>/final-faceless-reel.mp4 --audio-dir <output-directory>/audio/<topic-slug> --topic <topic-slug> --output <output-directory>
```

Never replace the final video until the character render has completed and been verified locally. Then ask:

> Characters are added. Can I add captions now?

If the user says yes, run:

```text
node <faceless-skill>/scripts/add-captions.mjs --video <output-directory>/video/<topic-slug>/final-faceless-reel.mp4 --script <output-directory>/scripts/<topic-slug>/dialogue.json --audio-dir <output-directory>/audio/<topic-slug> --topic <topic-slug> --output <output-directory>
```

Never replace the final video until the caption render has completed and been verified locally. Whether or not the user adds characters or captions, finish with:

> Your video is ready.

If the user wants further scene animation beyond the character/caption overlay this skill produces, the `flick` skill in this same repo covers that from a script or transcript.
